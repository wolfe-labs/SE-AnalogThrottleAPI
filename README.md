# AnalogThrottle In-game Script API
üïπÔ∏è API for interacting with the AnalogThrottle plugin from your in-game scripts

**Note:** this is still a work in progress and possibly may change later, specially regarding the format data is passed down to scripts. Make sure to keep updated to prevent script bugs/crashes!

## Installation

Make sure you have the [AnalogThrottle](https://github.com/wolfe-labs/SE-AnalogThrottlePlugin) plugin installed first, as it is the bridge between DirectInput's reading of controller data and your script!

When creating a script to be used with the API, add this Shared Project as a reference on your Visual Studio Project.

Add the following entry to the top of your C# `Program.cs` file too:

```cs
using IngameScript.WolfeLabs.AnalogThrottleAPI;
```

Finally, on your `Main` method, add the following line:

```cs
ControllerInputCollection inputs = ControllerInputCollection.FromString(argument);
```

With that done you should be ready to receive controller input directly in your script!

## Usage

Please keep in mind your Programmable Block **MUST** have the tag `[AnalogThrottle]` to work properly, otherwise the plugin will not communicate with it!

Now that you're receiving events on your script via the `Main()` method, you can process each of the different controller actions however you desire. This includes using joysticks to control slider-based values from any grid block, such as Thrusters, Pistons, Rotors, etc. This can be done by looping through the `ControllerInputCollection inputs` contents. Each entry will have the following properties available:

- `Source` - The name of the controller which sent that event
- `Axis` - The axis of that controller where the event happend
- `RawValue` - The raw value provided by the controller, as a `ushort`
- `AnalogValue` - The value above normalized into a range of 0 to 1, making it easier to use on sliders
- `DigitalValue` - The 1-bit digital representation of that value. Anything below `ushort.MaxValue` is `false`, anything above it is `true`
